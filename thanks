I would like to thank the following people for their helpfulness in writing
Catch the Furball:

Allen Downey, Jeffrey Elkner, and Chris Meyers, who wrote _How to Think Like a
    Computer Scientist: Learning with Python_ and published it free of charge
    on the web (http://ibiblio.org/CSpy). The book is aimed at beginners, but
    is written so that a more experienced programmer can find out how the
    language works fairly quickly.
Peta Dunstan, my tutor, who helped test the script and found important bugs.
David Marsden, who not only lent me his digital camera, but spent a couple of
    nights fighting with uncooperative computers on my behalf, and graciously
    provided the pictures for the Bridge, Et Cetera, and Meeting Place. (And
    probably other things I've forgotten.)
Mark Pilgrim, who wrote _Dive Into Python: Python for Experienced Programmers_
    and published it free of charge on the web (http://diveintopython.org): it
    helped me get up to writing code quickly.
My best friend Robin Munn, who introduced me to Python, reviewed my code, and
    discussed various language basics. (And probably other things I've
    forgotten.)
William Olhausen, for letting me take a photo shoot with his lovely guinea
    pigs.
Guido van Rossen (et al.!), for giving the world Python, and letting me
    develop this script much more quickly than I would have expected in other
    languages.
Various contributors to the official python documentation
    (http://www.python.org/doc), which let me find a lot of reference answers
    quickly.
Marcus Williams, who told me what I needed to do to fix a bug that left the
    script somewhat non-functional to visitors using IE.
