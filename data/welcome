<p style="margin-top: 0cm"><br><br><strong>Welcome to this virtual
tour!</strong></p>

<p>What do you do? Look at the picture and pretend you're in it. How do you
move around? Click on the center to move forward. Click on the left or right
side to turn. Click at the bottom to back up. (Or, if you want, click on the
arrows to move and to turn.) That's all there is to it.</p>

<p>The title at the top of the webpage tells you where you are. For instance,
now you are at <strong>"@TITLE@"</strong>. (If you want, you can <a
href="@URL@">start over</a>.)</p>
